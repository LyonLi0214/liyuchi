</text>
<text id="601019">11. SERVICE PROVIDED CONTENT:  “Service Provided Content" consists of all virtual materials, information and content provided to you (e.g., unlockable content, accounts, stats, virtual assets, virtual currencies, codes, achievements, virtual rewards, credits, access, shows, tokens, coins, power-ups, and customizations) in connection with your use of the Program, including the Online Services, which you need to "earn", "grind", "buy" and/or "purchase" in order to obtain additional content. 

While the Program may allow you to “earn,” “grind,” "buy," or "purchase" Service Provided Content within or in connection with gameplay, you do not in fact own or have any property interest in the Service Provided Content and the price of any Service Provided Content does not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent.  Unless otherwise specified in writing, any Service Provided Content that you receive is licensed to you as set forth herein, and you shall have no ownership right thereto in any Service Provided Content. You may not, sell, lend, rent, trade, or otherwise transfer any Service Provided Content, except for other Service Provided Content where applicable.  Any sale of Service Provided Content, including, but not limited to, virtual currency for “real” money or exchange of those items or virtual currency for value outside of the Program is prohibited.   Service Provided Content may be altered, removed, deleted, or discontinued by Activision (e.g., upon termination of this Agreement and/or cessation of online support for the Program as set out in Section 8) even if you have not “used” or “consumed” the Service Provided Content prior to alteration, removal, deletion, or discontinuation.  Without limiting the above, Service Provided Content may include virtual coins, points or other virtual currencies (“Virtual Currency”). 

</text>
<text id="601020">By purchasing or otherwise acquiring Virtual Currency, you obtain a limited license (which is revocable by Activision at any time unless otherwise required by applicable laws) to access and select from other Service Provided Content. Virtual Currency has no monetary value and does not constitute currency or property of any type. Virtual Currency may be redeemed for other Service Provided Content only, if at all. Subject to applicable local law, Virtual Currency is non-refundable. You are not entitled to a refund or any other compensation such as Service Provided Content for any unused Virtual Currency and unused Virtual Currency is non-exchangeable.  Activision may revise the pricing for the Service Provided Content and Virtual Currency offered through the Program at any time.  Activision may limit the total amount of Service Provided Content or Virtual Currency that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total amount of Service Provided Content or Virtual Currency that may be held in your account in the aggregate.  You are only allowed to purchase Service Provided Content or Virtual Currency from Activision or our authorized partners through the Program, and not in any other way.  Activision reserves the right to refuse your request(s) to acquire Service Provided Content and/or Virtual Currency.  You agree that you will be solely responsible for paying any applicable taxes related to the acquisition of, use of or access to Service Provided Content and/or Virtual Currency.

</text>
<text id="601021">There may be Service Provided Content (should you choose to purchase it) which will require you to make a payment with real money, the amount of which will be set out in the Program. All Service Provided Content will be made available immediately when you purchase it with real money and you acknowledge that this is the case and that you will have no right to change your mind and cancel (sometimes known as a 'cooling off' right) once your purchase is complete.  Depending on your platform, any Service Provided Content purchased, will be purchased from your platform provider and such purchase will be subject to their respective Terms of Service and User Agreement.

Activision may change and update Online Services or Service Provided Content without notice to you. Activision makes no warranty or representation regarding the availability of Online Services and reserves the right to modify or discontinue Online Services in its sole discretion without notice, including for example, ceasing an Online Service for economic reasons due to a limited number of users continuing to make use of the Online Service over time. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ONLINE SERVICES MAY BE TERMINATED IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT ACTIVISION’S SOLE DISCRETION WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, AND IN CONNECTION WITH ONLINE SERVICES’ TERMINATION, ANY AND ALL SERVICE PROVIDED CONTENT LICENSED TO YOU MAY BE TERMINATED.

READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.  IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

These BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or acquired and use the Program in the United States. These provisions may also apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or acquired and use the Program from outside the United States. See JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW below for details.

Initial Dispute Resolution:  Activision's Customer Support department is available at https://support.activision.com/ to address any concerns you may have regarding the Program. Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers' satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.

</text>
<text id="601030">Binding Arbitration:  If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the paragraph above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to formally resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including its interpretation, formation, performance and breach), the parties' relationship with each other and/or your use of the Program shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitrations Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act (the "FAA") shall apply to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and formation of this Agreement notwithstanding any other choice of law provision contained in this Agreement.  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement, including without limitation any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. 

</text>
<text id="601031">The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at http://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules, but shall not incorporate the JAMS Class Action Procedures, and, to the extent applicable, the Consumer Minimum Standards, including the then-current limit on arbitration filing fees. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Activision will pay the additional cost. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.  They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

</text>
<text id="601032">Location:  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Los Angeles County, California, and you and Activision agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Los Angeles County, California, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
 
Class Action Waiver:  The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND ACTIVISION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

</text>
<text id="601033">Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the Program under this Agreement. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.

30 Day Right to Opt Out:  You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in the "Binding Arbitration," "Location," and "Class Action Waiver" paragraphs above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: Activision Publishing, Inc., 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, CA 90405-3032, Attn: Legal. The notice must be sent within 30 days of purchasing the Program (or if no purchase was made, then within 30 days of the date on which you first access or use the Program and agree to these terms); otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Activision also will not be bound by them. 

Changes to this Section:  Activision will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to this Section. Changes will become effective on the 60th day and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.

For residents in North America-- INDEMNITY: You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Activision, its partners, affiliates, licensors, contractors, officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from all damages, losses and expenses arising directly or indirectly from your breach of this Agreement and/or your acts and omissions in using the Program pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 

</text>
<text id="602019">11. SERVICE PROVIDED CONTENT:  “Service Provided Content" consists of all virtual materials, information and content provided to you (e.g., unlockable content, accounts, stats, virtual assets, virtual currencies, codes, achievements, virtual rewards, credits, access, shows, tokens, coins, power-ups, and customizations) in connection with your use of the Program, including the Online Services, which you need to "earn", "grind", "buy" and/or "purchase" in order to obtain additional content. 

While the Program may allow you to “earn,” “grind,” "buy," or "purchase" Service Provided Content within or in connection with gameplay, you do not in fact own or have any property interest in the Service Provided Content and the price of any Service Provided Content does not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent.  Unless otherwise specified in writing, any Service Provided Content that you receive is licensed to you as set forth herein, and you shall have no ownership right thereto in any Service Provided Content. You may not, sell, lend, rent, trade, or otherwise transfer any Service Provided Content, except for other Service Provided Content where applicable.  Any sale of Service Provided Content, including, but not limited to, virtual currency for “real” money or exchange of those items or virtual currency for value outside of the Program is prohibited.   Service Provided Content may be altered, removed, deleted, or discontinued by Activision (e.g., upon termination of this Agreement and/or cessation of online support for the Program as set out in Section 8) even if you have not “used” or “consumed” the Service Provided Content prior to alteration, removal, deletion, or discontinuation.  Without limiting the above, Service Provided Content may include virtual coins, points or other virtual currencies (“Virtual Currency”). 

</text>
<text id="602020">By purchasing or otherwise acquiring Virtual Currency, you obtain a limited license (which is revocable by Activision at any time unless otherwise required by applicable laws) to access and select from other Service Provided Content. Virtual Currency has no monetary value and does not constitute currency or property of any type. Virtual Currency may be redeemed for other Service Provided Content only, if at all. Subject to applicable local law, Virtual Currency is non-refundable. You are not entitled to a refund or any other compensation such as Service Provided Content for any unused Virtual Currency and unused Virtual Currency is non-exchangeable.  Activision may revise the pricing for the Service Provided Content and Virtual Currency offered through the Program at any time.  Activision may limit the total amount of Service Provided Content or Virtual Currency that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total amount of Service Provided Content or Virtual Currency that may be held in your account in the aggregate.  You are only allowed to purchase Service Provided Content or Virtual Currency from Activision or our authorized partners through the Program, and not in any other way.  Activision reserves the right to refuse your request(s) to acquire Service Provided Content and/or Virtual Currency.  You agree that you will be solely responsible for paying any applicable taxes related to the acquisition of, use of or access to Service Provided Content and/or Virtual Currency.

</text>
<text id="602021">There may be Service Provided Content (should you choose to purchase it) which will require you to make a payment with real money, the amount of which will be set out in the Program. All Service Provided Content will be made available immediately when you purchase it with real money and you acknowledge that this is the case and that you will have no right to change your mind and cancel (sometimes known as a 'cooling off' right) once your purchase is complete.  Depending on your platform, any Service Provided Content purchased, will be purchased from your platform provider and such purchase will be subject to their respective Terms of Service and User Agreement. Please check usage rights for each purchase as these may differ from item to item. Unless otherwise shown, content available in any in-game store has the same age rating as the game.

The warranty for such Online Services and/or Service Provided Content is provided in accordance with your statutory rights as a consumer which will always prevail. Please see Section 7 in respect of Activision's limitation on damages, but nothing in this paragraph shall affect your statutory rights.

<text id="602029">16. For residents in North America-- BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER:

READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.  IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

These BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or acquired and use the Program in the United States. These provisions may also apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or acquired and use the Program from outside the United States. See JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW below for details.

Initial Dispute Resolution:  Activision's Customer Support department is available at https://support.activision.com/ to address any concerns you may have regarding the Program. Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers' satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.

</text>
<text id="602030">Binding Arbitration:  If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the paragraph above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to formally resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including its interpretation, formation, performance and breach), the parties' relationship with each other and/or your use of the Program shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitrations Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act (the "FAA") shall apply to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and formation of this Agreement notwithstanding any other choice of law provision contained in this Agreement.  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement, including without limitation any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. 

</text>
<text id="602031">The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at http://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules, but shall not incorporate the JAMS Class Action Procedures, and, to the extent applicable, the Consumer Minimum Standards, including the then-current limit on arbitration filing fees. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Activision will pay the additional cost. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.  They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

</text>
<text id="602032">Location:  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Los Angeles County, California, and you and Activision agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Los Angeles County, California, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
 
Class Action Waiver:  The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND ACTIVISION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

</text>
<text id="602033">Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the Program under this Agreement. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.

30 Day Right to Opt Out:  You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in the "Binding Arbitration," "Location," and "Class Action Waiver" paragraphs above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: Activision Publishing, Inc., 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, CA 90405-3032, Attn: Legal. The notice must be sent within 30 days of purchasing the Program (or if no purchase was made, then within 30 days of the date on which you first access or use the Program and agree to these terms); otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Activision also will not be bound by them. 

Changes to this Section:  Activision will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to this Section. Changes will become effective on the 60th day and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.

Service Provided Content: In addition to the above, the following Right of Withdrawal shall apply to German residents.

If you are a consumer (i.e. a natural person who enters into a legal transaction for purposes that predominantly are outside his trade, business or profession), then you shall have a right of withdrawal as set out hereafter.

</text>
<text id="602039">Information concerning the exercise of the right of withdrawal

Right of Withdrawal

You have the right to withdraw from any Purchase Contract within 14 calendar days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period will expire after 14 calendar days from the day of the conclusion of the Purchase Contract.

</text>
<text id="602040">Effects of withdrawal

If you withdraw from the Purchase Contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you under this Purchase Contract, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 calendar days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this Purchase Contract.

If you requested to begin the performance of services under a Purchase Contract during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated us your withdrawal from that Purchase Contract, in comparison with the full coverage of these services under the Purchase Contract.

</text>
<text id="602041">End of the information concerning the exercise of the right of withdrawal

You lose your right of withdrawal, insofar as the Purchase Contract is a service contract, after the service has been fully performed and if the performance has begun with your prior express consent, and with the acknowledgement that you will lose your right of withdrawal once the service has been fully performed by us.

You lose your right of withdrawal insofar as the Purchase Contract comprises the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with your prior express consent and your acknowledgment that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal.

Based on the aforesaid you understand that by purchasing Service Provided Content, you consent that we make available these Service Provided Content to you directly after we have accepted your order. You will lose your right of withdrawal once the Service Provided Content have been made fully available to you by us.
